# Polarimeter

This repository contains the Python code for a home-built [polarimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarimeter). It uses the method of differential polarimetery with a rotating analyzer, as described by [Vishnyakov _et al_](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOT.78.000124). The code is commented, but documentation will appear as I write my PhD thesis.
